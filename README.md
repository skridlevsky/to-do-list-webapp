Simple to-do web application created with ASP.NET Core. I have created this application to gain fundamental understanding of ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework.

# To-do list to self for the "to-do list" web application
- [x] To-do list will use SQLite database engine to store to-do list data.
- [x] User has an input field where to type in an item to the list.
- [x] User can add a deadline when to-do should be finished.
- [x] User can add item to the list by pressing enter or a button after typing item in.
- [x] User can mark an item as completed and it will disappear from the list.
- [ ] User can remove or edit an item by pressing on a button.
- [x] User can switch between active and completed to-do list.
- [x] Use Razor Pages Identity to ensure that every registered user has their own list.
- [ ] Add pagination in case if to-do list grows larger.
- [ ] Implement a fancy and responsive website design, to ensure that the person who views this does not feel like he has returned to 2001 and needs to travel back to the future as soon as possible. Very important life-saving. Do not skip.
